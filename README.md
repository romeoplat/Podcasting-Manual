# Handbook for Effective Online Training in Post-Conflict or Low Internet Areas

 ## Section 1: Preparing for Online Training

### Introduction:

Online training and webinars have become essential tools for education and capacity-building in various contexts, including post-conflict regions and low-internet areas. This handbook aims to provide comprehensive guidance, tools, and resources to ensure successful virtual training in challenging environments. By implementing the following strategies and utilizing appropriate tools, trainers can maximize the impact of their online sessions and facilitate effective learning experiences for participants.

### 1.1 Assessing Internet Connectivity:

Before conducting online training, it is crucial to assess internet availability and quality in the target area. Tools like Speedtest.net (https://www.speedtest.net/) can help participants check their internet speed and stability. Conducting a network assessment will aid in understanding potential challenges and finding solutions.

### 1.2 Selecting the Right Platform:

Choosing a suitable platform is essential for a successful training experience. In low-internet areas, platforms that offer offline functionalities and accommodate unstable connections are ideal. 

For instance, Google Workspace (https://workspace.google.com/) provides offline access to documents, slides, and emails, allowing participants to continue learning during internet disruptions.

Here are some open-source options:

- BigBlueButton (https://bigbluebutton.org/): An open-source web conferencing system designed for online learning and webinars. It provides real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and screen.

- Jitsi (https://jitsi.org/): An open-source platform for video conferencing and webinars that can work well in low-bandwidth environments.



### 1.3 Preparing Participants:

Preparing participants for the online training is crucial to ensure smooth participation. Sharing clear instructions on technical requirements and platform usage can be achieved through resources like this guide on joining Zoom meetings (https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362193-Joining-a-Meeting).

Conducting pre-training sessions or orientation webinars can help participants become familiar with the virtual setup. Here's an example of an orientation webinar guide (https://www.learncube.com/blog/online-class-orientation-tips-for-students).

## Section 2: Designing Effective Online Training

### 2.1 Adapting Content for Virtual Delivery:

When designing online training, breaking down complex topics into shorter modules is beneficial, as it keeps participants engaged and enhances understanding. Tools like Canva (https://www.canva.com/) can assist in creating visually appealing presentations and handouts to support the learning process.

### 2.2 Encouraging Interactivity:

Engaging participants through interactive elements is vital. Platforms like Mentimeter (https://www.mentimeter.com/) enable trainers to conduct live polls, quizzes, and word clouds, fostering active participation. Additionally, Zoom offers breakout rooms for group discussions and collaboration (https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313).

### 2.3 Building Engaging Materials:

Using storytelling and real-life examples can make the training more captivating and relatable. TED Talks (https://www.ted.com/) is an excellent resource for finding inspiring stories that can be incorporated into training materials.

## Section 3: Tools and Resources for Online Training

### 3.1 Low-Bandwidth Communication Tools:

In areas with limited internet access, text-based communication platforms like WhatsApp (https://www.whatsapp.com/) or Telegram (https://telegram.org/) can be valuable for disseminating essential information. They consume less data than video-based communication tools.

### 3.2 Offline Learning:

Utilizing Learning Management Systems (LMS) that support offline content downloads enables participants to access training materials without an internet connection. Moodle (https://moodle.org/) is an open-source LMS that offers offline learning capabilities.

### 3.3 Webinar Platforms with Low Bandwidth Support:

Zoom's Low Bandwidth Mode (https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005562643-Low-Bandwidth-Mode) is specifically designed for areas with limited internet access, ensuring a smoother experience for participants.

## Section 4: Ensuring Participation and Inclusivity

### 4.1 Cultivate Inclusive Training:

To accommodate different learning styles and preferences, provide closed captions for live sessions and recordings. 
YouTube (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/100078?hl=en) offers an automatic closed captioning feature.

### 4.2 Encouraging Active Engagement:

Maintaining participant focus during longer sessions can be achieved by scheduling regular breaks. Tools like Time Timer (https://www.timetimer.com/) can help trainers manage session durations effectively.

## Section 5: Monitoring and Evaluation

### 5.1 Assessing Participant Learning:

Using pre and post-training assessments helps trainers gauge knowledge retention and tailor future sessions. Google Forms (https://www.google.com/forms/about/) is a user-friendly tool for creating surveys and quizzes.

### 5.2 Evaluating Training Impact:

Measuring the effectiveness of the training can be done through qualitative and quantitative methods. The Kirkpatrick Model (https://www.kirkpatrickpartners.com/Our-Philosophy/The-Kirkpatrick-Model) is a widely used evaluation framework.




### Conclusion:
By incorporating the examples and using the provided links to websites, this handbook offers detailed guidance on how to handle online training in post-conflict or low-internet areas. Proper preparation, suitable tools, and inclusive approaches will ensure effective learning experiences for all participants. Utilizing open-source options can further enhance accessibility and sustainability in challenging environments.
